# Best Value NFL Plays

The goal of this paper is to ultimately find which type of play yields the best results in any given situation of an NFL game. Game situations are defined by the game clock (quarter, time left on the quarter), point differential, field position, and yards to go for a first time. Although teams have their own analytical teams to run their own models, this project is useful for fans/viewers that are interested in using statistical reasoning on why certain plays are more suited for different situations.

Data was collected by the National Football League and this analysis will use play-by-play data from the 2021 NFL season.
